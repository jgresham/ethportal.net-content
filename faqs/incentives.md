Simply put: Incorrectly implemented incentives lead to perverse incentives.

Using financial incentives is a natural choice for many crypto/blockchain protocols. Well-designed incentives can be a powerful tool to encourage proper-use and discourage malicious behavior. Incentives might seem especially well-suited for the Portal Network, where the strength of the network is correlated to the number of participants and the amount of contributed computing resources. However, at the current point in time, Portal Network developers have opted out from implementing financial incentives.

The problems with financial incentives is they are complex and difficult to implement correctly. They also provide mechanisms for people to game the system and extract value, rather than contribute towards overall network health. The Portal Network relies on producing a useful, lightweight client for developers, along with altruism and laziness to encourage network adoption and sufficient computing resources.

Protocols like Bittorrent and IPFS are proof that this is a feasible strategy. Furthermore, there already exist protocols like the Filecoin and The Graph Network that are using financial incentives to accomplish similar goals to the Portal Network.
