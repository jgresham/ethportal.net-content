# Contributing
## Introduction
The introduction copy lives in the `/introduction.md` file at the root of the repo and is actively being worked on.

## FAQs
### Existing FAQs
There are a number of pre-seeded FAQs to be worked on. Please check the open [Issues](https://github.com/njgheorghita/ethportal.net-content/issues) on the repo to see which questions have not yet been started / claimed by a community member before you begin your work.

Answers to questions shoud be opened as [Pull Requests](https://github.com/njgheorghita/ethportal.net-content/pulls) with the format: `Answer: "Name of the question here?"`

### New FAQs
To create a new FAQ create a new `.md` file in the `/faqs` directory using the structure provided in the `/faqs/_template.md` file. Do not modify the `_template.md` file directly.

The title of your FAQ `.md` file should generally be a kebab-case version of your FAQ question title.

Please try to keep similar topic FAQs logically grouped together.

## Authorship
Anonymous authorship is acceptable - but given you'll need a GitHub account to contribute anyways please consider at least listing that if you're not comfortable linking your answer to a public internet profile such as Twitter or Reddit.

Questions can have multiple author attributions - and they'll be shown in order of contribution - not sorted by magnitude except in cases of extreme outliers. So, **just because a question has an answer please don't feel like you can't submit improvements to it!**

## Notice
Not all contributions are guaranteed to be merged - but all contributions are appreciated.

## Attribution
This repo is heavily inspired by the [`ethmerge.com` repo](https://github.com/InsideTheSim/ethmerge.com-content)
