The "Portal Network" is an in progess effort to enable lightweight protocol access to resource constrained devices. The term "portal" is used to indicate that these networks provide a view into the protocol but are not critical to the operation of the core Ethereum protocol.

The Portal Network will be comprised of one or more decentralized peer-to-peer networks which together provide the data and functionality necessary to expose the standard JSON-RPC API. These networks are being specially designed to ensure that clients participating in these networks can do so with minimal expendature of networking bandwidth, CPU, RAM, and HDD resources.
